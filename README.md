<h2> Bug-Tracker </h1>

Bug tracking is the process of logging and monitoring bugs or errors during software testing.

<h2> Web pages descripion </h2>

<h3> Register page </h3>

- A user can enter the requested details and register on the website. It has custom errors that
  enforce certain rules.

<h3> Login page </h3>

- If a user already registered and his/her account was approved by the administrator, he/she can
  successfully login to the site.
  
- If you just want to see how the website works and are not interested in creating your own profile,
  there is " Demo Login " link to enter the site as a guest and the best part is you have the role of
  an administrator meaning you can do/edit almost anything in the site. Poor idea but it is for people
  to see how the site works

<h3> Main/Project page </h3>

- The administrator can see all the projects currently on the sites, but the developers can only see 
  projects assigned to them by the administrator
- The administrator can create new projects, edit existing ones and add users to the project

<h3> User Management page </h3>

- Can only be accessed by the administrator
- You can view specific user details, edit their profile and delete them. 
- Users can be sorted by a certain role

<h3> Role Management page </h3>

- Roles are titles given to users to limit them on what they can do on the website
- List all roles currently available
- Can only be accessed by the administrator

<h3> ProjectTicket page </h3>

-  List all the tickets for a project selected in the main page grouped by status

   implemented in certain section of the software
