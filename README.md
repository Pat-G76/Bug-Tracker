<h2> Bug-Tracker </h1>

Bug tracking is the process of logging and monitoring bugs or errors during software testing.

<h2> Web pages descripion </h2>

<h3> Register page </h3>

- A user can enter the requested details and register to the website. It has costom errors that
  enforce certain rules.

<h3> Login page </h3>

- If a user already registered and his/her account was approved by the administrator, he/she can
  successfully login to the site.
  
- If you just want to see how the website works and are not interested in creating your own profile,
  there is " Demo Login " link to enter the site as a guest and the best part is you have the role of
  an administrator meaning you can do/edit almost anything in the site. Poor idea but it is for people
  to see how the site works

<h3> Main/Project page </h3>

<h4> Administrator </h4>

- A user with administrator role can see all the projects currently on the sites and users with developer
  role can only see projects assigned to them by the administrator.
